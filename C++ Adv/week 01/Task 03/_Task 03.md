## Task 3 – Order
You are given program in an **OrderMain.cpp** file that reads info about **companies** – **name** and **id** – and then prints them ordered by their id, in increasing order. To describe a company, it uses the **Company.h** file, which you are also given.

To order the companies, **OrderMain.cpp** uses a class named **OrderedInserter** from a file named **OrderedInserter.h** – it initializes it with an empty vector of companies, then calls a method named **insert** for each company in the input, then prints the contents of the **vector**.

Your task is to study the code in **OrderMain.cpp**, then create a file called **OrderedInserter.h** (which **OrderMain.cpp** includes) containing the definition of the **OrderedInserter** class, written in such a way that **Main.cpp** compiles successfully and works as described above.

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **OrderedInserter.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them along with your **OrderedInserter.h** file in the same directory.

To correctly use the **Company** definition, without interfering with its usage by **OrderMain.cpp**, use the following structure for the **OrderedInserter.h** file:

#### OderedInserter.h
```cpp
#ifndef ORDERED_INSERTER_H 
#define ORDERED_INSERTER_H

#include "Company.h"

// Place your code here, as well as any other #include directives you might need

#endif // !ORDERED_INSERTER_H
```
