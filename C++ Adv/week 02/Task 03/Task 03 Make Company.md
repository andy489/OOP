## Task 3 – Make Company

You are given program in an **MakeCompanyMain.cpp**, as well as a **Company.h** file, that read information about **companies** and writes it to the console.

Each company has:
-	An id (a 4-byte integer)
-	A name (a string containing a sequence of lowercase English letters a-z)
-	Employees by their initials (a vector of pairs of characters, containing at most 255 employee initials)
The **MakeCompanyMain.cpp** file reads the information from the console as a single line for each company, containing:
-	company id string 
-	space
-	company name
-	2 characters representing the initials of the first employee
-	Space
-	Again 2 characters, representing the second employee
-	… and so on
NOTE: there could be companies without employees, in which case the line ends with the company name.
For example, if we have the companies:
-	**id = 42, name = "uni", employees = { {'I', 'K'}, {'S', 'N'} }** and <br>
**id = 13, name = "joro", employees = { {'G', 'G' } }**

Their representation as **strings** read by **MemoryMain.cpp** will be:

**42 uni IK SN**
**13 joro GG**

The program reads each line from the console, then calls a function named **makeCompany** to **dynamically allocate memory** for a **Company** object and set its values, then prints its representation as a back to the console (i.e. the program should print the exact line it read), until a line containing the single string **"end"** is reached.

Your task is to create a file called **MakeCompany.h** containing the function **makeCompany** such that the program compiles successfully and performs the described task.

Your file should resemble the following:
```cpp
#ifndef MAKE_COMPANY_H
#define MAKE_COMPANY_H

#include "Company.h"

// Place your code here

#endif // !MAKE_COMPANY_H
```
You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **MakeCompany.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

####vAdditional Requirements

Make sure you correctly create the Company objects and ensure that there are **no memory leaks**.
