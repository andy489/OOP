## Task 1 â€“ MinBy

You are given code for a program, which finds the minimum element of a list of strings entered on the console (lowercase English letters, separated by spaces). The program has 3 modes of operation, each with using a different characteristic for finding the minimum:
- 1.	Lexicographical minimum i.e. finds the string that is earliest lexicographically
- 2.	Size minimum i.e. finds the shortest string
- 3.	Reverse size minimum i.e. finds the longest string

The code is missing the MinBy.h file. Your task is to study the provided code and create a MinBy.h file such that the program compiles successfully and performs the described task.

Your **MinBy.h** file should resemble the following:
```cpp
#ifndef MIN_BY_H
#define MIN_BY_H

// Place your code here

#endif // !MIN_BY_H
```
You should submit a single .zip file for this task, containing ONLY the **MinBy.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
Restrictions
There will always be at least 1 string in the list of strings entered from the console. There will be no empty strings.
